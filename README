The project is set up to look for Assembly-CSharp.dll and UnityEngine.dll in
the externalReferences directory. This helps the automated build script.

The build script is invoked on linux by running ./build-release.sh
I know it seems redundant to re-download the whole project just to build it,
but this makes it easy for me to guarantee that the released assembly
corresponds exactly to a tag which has been committed to the repository on
github.
