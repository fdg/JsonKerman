Json Kerman is an external web interface to Kerbal Space program, allowing
(among other things) players to use other displays and devices to show extra
information relating to their current game.
The end goal is an interactive display kind of like RasterPropMonitor but
running on a tablet.

The project is set up to look for Assembly-CSharp.dll and UnityEngine.dll in
the externalReferences directory. This helps the automated build script.

The build script is invoked on linux by running ./build-release.sh vX.X.X
I know it seems redundant to re-download the whole project just to build it,
but this makes it easy for me to guarantee that the released assembly
corresponds exactly to a tag which has been committed to the repository on
github.
